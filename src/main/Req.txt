Alberto, Tim, Paul, and I decided our priorities for September are basic pre-processing for us to apply AntConc to the testimonies:

1. Q&A – Separate/markup headers and footers and separate interviewer from interviewee.

2. Separate/markup testimonies by name so we can distinguish between them. (Or we can do this manually if need be.)

3. Give us subcorpora of men vs. women, for gender comparison.

4. Even having 100 clean testimonies would help us. Having the whole set (approx. 800) would be terrific.


Priorities by end of the grant (December 31, 2017) – in addition to the above:
5. Semantic lexicon of appropriate terms for semantic tagging with Wmatrix3.

6. Subcorpora of testimonies of people who went through Krakow and those who went through Budapest.

7. Run the dataset through a geoparser – Anne will talk with Ian about what export/output format we will need when he's in Maine in late September.
